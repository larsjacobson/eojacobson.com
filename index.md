# Welcome  

My research lies at the intersection of **medical image computing**, **artificial intelligence**, and **computational modelling**, with a particular emphasis on **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**. I develop advanced **deep learning architectures** that combine **multi-stage processing pipelines**, **ensemble learning strategies**, and the integration of **domain expertise** to enhance the precision and reliability of automated image segmentation.  

Beyond static image analysis, I am exploring **temporal modelling frameworks** that capture longitudinal patient dynamics, enabling more accurate and personalised predictions of clinical outcomes. A further strand of my work concerns the design of **computationally efficient machine learning systems**, ensuring that methodological advances can be translated into scalable, trustworthy, and clinically deployable technologies.
